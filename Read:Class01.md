## Reading
### Layers of OSI Model

### What does “OSI” stand for?
OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection, which is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers.

### List the 7 layers of the OSI model and what each one is responsible for. Distinguish which layers are the “hardware layers”, and which layers are the “software layers”. What does that even mean?
1. Physical Layer-Hardware  
2. Data Link Layer Hardware
3. Network Layer Software
4. Transport Layer Software
5. Session Layer Software
6. Presentation Layer Software
7. Application Layer Software

Hardware Layers: The physical layer and the data link layer are considered hardware layers because they deal with the physical transmission of data over the network, including the physical components and connections.

Software Layers: The network, transport, session, presentation, and application layers are considered software layers. They focus on providing communication  and managing the interaction between applications, independent of the physical infrastructure.


### How can the OSI model be used in troubleshooting?
The OSI model can be used to troubleshooting 
### What Is Wireshark and How Is It Used?

Feel free to stop at “How to Use Wireshark”
### 1. What is Wireshark?
### 2. What is a packet?
### 3. What 3 high-level things does Wireshark accomplish? How could these be used for nefarious purposes? For benevolent purposes?
