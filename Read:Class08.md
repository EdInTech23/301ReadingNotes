# Reading
## Computer Network - AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting)

#### Explain each of the three A’s as you would to a non-technical family member. Use an analogy or a story.
The first A is Authentication: This is like checking someone's ID at the door.
The second A is Authorization: This is like deciding what someone can do once theyre inside. 
The third A is Accounting: This is like keeping track of what people do while they're inside. 
#### What should the administrator do if the ACS server fails to authenticate a user during AAA implementation?
1. Analyze the Logs 
2. Verify User Credentials
3. Validate AAA Client Configuration
4. Perform Test Authentication
5. Contact Cisco Support
#### What is the role of the NAS in the AAA implementation using an ACS server? Use a diagram.
The NAS is the entry point for user access and facilitates communication with the ACS server.
It collects user credentials, transmits authentication requests, and enforces access control based on ACS server decisions.
The NAS also plays a vital role in logging and reporting user activity for auditing purposes.
RADIUS Concepts

#### What are the benefits of using RADIUS for authentication and authorization?
Enhanced Security
Improved Scalability
Increased Efficiency
Additional Benefits

#### What is RADIUS and what does it stand for?
RADIUS stands for Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service. It is a networking protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) management for users who connect and use a network service.

#### Research: What encryption algorithms does RADIUS use?
 MD5
 MD5 XOR 
TLS/DTLS
MS-CHAPv2
